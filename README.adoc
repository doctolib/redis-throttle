= RedisThrottle

Redis based rate limit and concurrency throttling.


== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    $ bundle add redis-throttle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install redis-throttle


== Usage

=== Concurrency Limit

[source,ruby]
----
# Allow 1 concurrent calls. If call takes more than 10 seconds, consider it
# gone (as if process died, or by any other reason did not called `#release`):
concurrency = RedisThrottle.concurrency(:bucket_name,
  limit: 1,
  ttl:   10
)

concurrency.acquire(redis, token: "abc") # => "abc"
concurrency.acquire(redis, token: "xyz") # => nil

concurrency.release(redis, token: "abc")

concurrency.acquire(redis, token: "xyz") # => "xyz"
----

=== Rate Limit

[source,ruby]
----
# Allow 1 calls per 10 seconds:
rate_limit = RedisThrottle.rate_limit(:bucket_name,
  limit:  1,
  period: 10
)

rate_limit.acquire(redis) # => "6a6c6546-268d-4216-bcf3-3139b8e11609"
rate_limit.acquire(redis) # => nil

sleep 10

rate_limit.acquire(redis) # => "e2926a90-2cf4-4bff-9401-65f3a70d32bd"
----


=== Multi-strategy

[source,ruby]
----
throttle = RedisThrottle
  .concurrency(:db, limit: 3, ttl: 900)
  .rate_limit(:api_minutely, limit: 1, period: 60)
  .rate_limit(:api_hourly, limit: 10, period: 3600)

throttle.call(redis, token: "abc") do
  # do something if all strategies are resolved
end
----

You can also compose multiple throttlers together:

[source,ruby]
----
db_limiter  = RedisThrottle.concurrency(:db, limit: 3, ttl: 900)
api_limiter = RedisThrottle
  .rate_limit(:api_minutely, limit: 1, period: 60)
  .rate_limit(:api_hourly, limit: 10, period: 3600)

(db_limiter + api_limiter).call(redis) do
  # ...
end
----


== Compatibility

This library aims to support and is tested against:

* https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby]
** MRI 3.0.x
** MRI 3.1.x
** MRI 3.2.x
* https://redis.io[Redis Server]
** 6.0.x
** 6.2.x
** 7.0.x
** 7.2.x
* https://github.com/redis/redis-rb[redis-rb]
** 4.1.x
** 4.2.x
** 4.3.x
** 4.4.x
** 4.5.x
** 4.6.x
** 4.7.x
** 4.8.x
** 5.0.x
* https://github.com/resque/redis-namespace[redis-namespace]
** 1.10.x
* https://github.com/redis-rb/redis-client[redis-client]
** 0.12.x
** 0.13.x
** 0.14.x

If something doesn't work on one of these versions, it's a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby versions,
however support will only be provided for the versions listed above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version or
implementation, you may volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer
entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. When
something breaks on your implementation, you will be responsible for providing
patches in a timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation
exist at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be
dropped.

The same applies to *Redis Server*, *redis-rb*, *redis-namespace*,
and *redis-client* support.
